<!---
I am an Operations and Data Analyst specializing in the foodtech and operations sectors, with a keen eye for detail and the unique ability to ask the right questions.

Passionate about leveraging my experience to serve a greater purpose, I am driven to collaborate with individuals who share my dedication.

My ultimate goal is to devise strategies and solutions that uplift vulnerable communities and create a meaningful impact. Instead of enhancing the top-tier, my commitment lies in bettering the lives of those truly in need.
